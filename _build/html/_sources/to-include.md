Create section on Web 3.0 - history of the internet

"In a matter of 30 years, the internet has grown 500-fold from a community of 10 million users in 1993 to over 5 billion users today. Unfortunately, the ascent of Web 2.0 has coincided with a departure from the ideals of creating a global network to transparently share information for the benefit of all users. With increasing traffic in Web 2.0, business models have steadily shifted away from providing services crafted for user needs and towards processing user data to generate advertising revenue. In effect, users themselves have become the “products” that are sold to corporate marketing departments.

Journalism in Web 2.0 has followed a similar trajectory, where the appeal of advertising revenue has incentivized the distribution of “clickbait” instead of curated content. This has resulted in an emphasis on the quantity of information over the quality and the prioritization of attention-grabbing headlines in lieu of the stories themselves

## Sustainable dvpt goals

### SDG 16

SDG 16 not only recognizes the importance of obtaining information for achieving sustainable development, but it also promotes the protection of those producing it and calls for actions to consider the challenges they are facing. Media personnel, especially journalists and citizen journalists, are constantly looking for information, analyzing and distributing it. Thanks to their efforts, we can have the information needed to oversee achievement of the SDGs
